# Practical Work on Supervised Learning

## Overview

This practical work serves as an introduction to supervised learning, a cornerstone of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. Supervised learning models predict the output for a given input after having learned from a training set that provides correct examples of input-output pairs. This module emphasizes understanding, implementing, and evaluating various supervised learning algorithms through hands-on exercises.

## Theory and Techniques

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. This methodology enables the model to learn a function that maps inputs to desired outputs, which can then be applied to new, unseen data. Supervised learning can be broadly categorized into classification and regression problems.

### Classification Algorithms
In the toy classification notebook, we explore the foundational classification algorithms. Classification involves categorizing data into predefined classes. The notebook likely covers various classifiers, illustrating how they learn to segregate different classes based on training data.

### Regression Techniques
In the advanced exercises and solutions, we delve into regression techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net. Regression models predict a continuous output variable based on input features. These methods are essential for understanding how to minimize prediction errors through optimization.

### Additional Concepts
- **SVD Decomposition:** A mathematical technique used in some of the algorithms for decomposing matrices, aiding in the understanding of data structure and solving optimization problems.
- **Variances:** Understanding variance is crucial for evaluating model performance, especially in terms of overfitting or underfitting.
- **Bias and Variance Trade-off:** A fundamental concept in machine learning that helps in achieving the right balance between model simplicity (bias) and its ability to learn from training data without overfitting (variance).
- **Relation between Estimators:** The notebooks explore the relationships between different estimation techniques, providing insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to various types of data.
